5-DESIGN DECISIONS & ISSUES
--------
running out of time so submitting. =(
Major Issues: having issues with safe termination, and msgsnd and msgrcv.
--crashes from floating point error, these happens when its broken and writes a massive logfile of pagetable
--crashes when sends interrupt signal during msgsnd. (must use ctrl-c) to escape. (paging should work during these and produce and approprite logfile.dat)
--works half the time to fix and rerun after these in attempt to get a readable logfile
---remove logFile.dat
---make clean
---rerun program
--paging is using FIFO algo until i can fix these other issues. paging FIFO works, but I am having issues with the msgsnd and msgrcv sending and receiving information for the frame table. process and pageNumber specifically.
--SUBMITTING with a copy of a somewhat working logFile, it shows the paging working. but process and pagenumber are not being assigned to their page index correctly.
